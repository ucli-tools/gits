- **Platform Authentication**: Login and logout functionality for both GitHub and Gitea.
- **Branch Management**: Create, delete, and manage branches easily.
- **Repository Initialization**: Initialize a new Git repository and push it to GitHub.
- **Commit Management**: Revert to previous commits and undo reverts.
- **Repository Cloning**: Easily clone repositories and switch to their directory.
- **Easy Installation**: Simple install and uninstall process.
- **User-Friendly**: Colorized output and helpful error messages.
- **Repository Management**: Create and delete repositories on both GitHub and Gitea
- **Multiple Platform Support**: Seamless integration with both GitHub and Gitea

## Prerequisites

To use GitS, you need:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) - Required for all git operations
- [gh](https://cli.github.com/) - Required for GitHub PR management and authentication
- [tea](https://gitea.com/gitea/tea) - Required for Gitea PR management and authentication
- Makefile (optional)

Both `gh` and `tea` are only required if you plan to use their respective platform features.

## Installation

If you have `make` installed, you can simply run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mik-TF/gits.git
cd gits
bash gits.sh install
```

This will copy the script to `/usr/local/bin/gits`, making it accessible system-wide. You'll need to enter your sudo password.
